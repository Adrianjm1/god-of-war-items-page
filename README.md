## Design and Assets

The design is based on the provided PDF. No mobile design was included, so controls and elements have been adapted to smaller screens based on my experience.

I chose to use a "God of War" theme for this project. All images and assets were sourced from websites related to "God of War", adding a personal touch and unique theme to the design.

## Live Demo

If possible, provide a link to a live demo of your application.

## Design Choices

The primary design choice was to use a grid layout. This was chosen because it provides a flexible and efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. It allows for easy responsiveness and ensures a uniform appearance across different screen sizes.

For smaller screens, a hamburger menu was implemented for navigation. This is a common design pattern for mobile sites, as it conserves space and provides a clean, uncluttered user interface. When clicked, it expands to display the navigation options.
